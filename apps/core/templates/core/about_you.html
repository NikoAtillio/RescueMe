                    <h2>Why Preparation Matters</h2>
                    <p>Many animals in rescue shelters have already experienced upheaval and uncertainty in their lives. By being well-prepared for adoption, you can provide a stable, loving environment from day one.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rescue centers have a responsibility to ensure their animals go to suitable homes, which is why they often have application processes and home checks. These aren't designed to catch you out - they're there to make sure both you and your new pet will be happy together.</p>
                    
                    <p>By using the resources in this section, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the adoption process and provide a forever home for an animal in need.</p>
